    "<p><code>pandas</code> is a Python library that facilitates a wide range of data analysis and manipulation. Before, you saw basic data structures in Python such as lists and dictionaries. While you can build a basic data table (similar to an Excel spreadsheet) using nested lists in Python, they get quite difficult to work with. By contrast, in <code>pandas</code> the table data structure, known as a <code>DataFrame</code>, is a first-class citizen and you can easily manipulate your data thinking of it in rows and columns.</p>\n",
    "<p>If you've ever used or heard of R or SQL before, <code>pandas</code> brings some functionality from each of these to Python, allowing you to structure and filter data more efficiently than pure Python. This efficiency is seen in two distinct ways:</p>\n",

This is to sanity check that our final DataFrame is roughly what we expect. Notice the aggregated DataFrame has the same number of columns as the original single stock (D) data, however the number of rows have increased five-fold. This makes sense, because each additional symbol contains 1259 data entries, so five symbols leads to a total of <code>1259*5 = 6295</code> rows. So, this passes our sanity check.</p>"

    "<p>One immediate observation of note is that the volatility level on any given day can vary widely. This is evident from the wide spread between the minimum and maximum <code>VolStat</code> levels seen using the <code>describe()</code> method. For example, stock symbol D has a minimum <code>VolStat</code> value of 0.003640, while its maximum <code>VolStat</code> value is 0.062350. That's more than a 10x increase in the value of <code>VolStat</code>!</p>\n",
    "<p>While this is great to see, there is a more powerful way to display this data in <code>pandas</code>. We can call the <code>describe()</code> method directly on the <code>DataFrameGroupBy</code> object. This one line allows you to avoid having to write a <code>for</code> loop every time you'd like to summarize data:</p>"

    "1. **EXC leads in structural volatility**  \n",
    "   * Mean and median ~20 % higher than peers.  \n",
    "   * 75 th percentile (0.0218) confirms volatility isn’t limited to outliers—it is consistently high.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DUK displays extreme-event risk**  \n",
    "   * Maximum (0.1175) nearly double the next highest.  \n",
    "   * Largest standard deviation, indicating the widest dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **D and NEE share a “moderate-stable” profile**  \n",
    "   * Nearly identical central tendencies and dispersion.  \n",
    "   * Max values ≤ 0.06, so spikes are contained relative to DUK.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SO is the calmest asset**  \n",
    "   * Lowest mean and variance.  \n",
    "   * Narrow volatility band makes it attractive for conservative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Coefficient of variation is similar (~0.43–0.49)** across symbols, yet **risk sources differ**:  \n",
    "   * **EXC**: consistently higher day-to-day volatility.  \n",
    "   * **DUK**: moderate day-to-day moves but prone to large one-off jumps.  \n",
    "   * **SO/D/NEE**: tighter, more predictable ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Defensive or hedging strategies** → favor **SO**, with **D/NEE** as secondary options.  \n",
    "* **Leveraged trading or option writing** → **EXC** provides the continuous volatility required.  \n",
    "* **Risk management for DUK** → set wider stop-losses or hedge against sudden spikes.  "

It is critical you become as familiar with <code>pandas</code> as possible and it is imperative that you continue researching/investigating new components of this library after the completion of this program. What we have taught here are only the essential basics of <code>pandas</code>; there is still a vast amount of power to the library that you will discover and utilize later on in your development as a data professional.</p>\n",

You should know the various DataFrame/Series methods we introduced here as well as how to carry out common operations on data, such as finding percentiles, before you consider yourself to have \"mastered\" this material.</p>"
